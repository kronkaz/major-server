    [Major](https://github.com/kronkaz/major-server) is an implementation of the
    [majority judgment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_judgment) voting system, as a side
    project, along with a mobile application, and possibly deployed on the web.

    This page documents the API to be used on the client side to interact with the voting server.

        The voter enters their ID and password to get into the system.
        The server answers with an _access token_ that has to be included in all the following
        calls to the API, as a [_bearer_ authentication header](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750).


        The access token is a [_JWT token_](https://jwt.io) containing the voter ID and the expiry
        date of the token.
        It is signed and encrypted by the server, so it is useless on the client side.
        Nevertheless, the client can call `/whoami` with the token in the headers to obtain
        the voter information.


        The response also includes a _refresh token_, that is meant to be used in case the client
        wants to remain connected for longer than allowed by the expiry date.
        In this case, the client must call this endpoint, either with the `GET` method requiring
        credentials, or the `PATCH` method only requiring the refresh token.
        This was designed so that credentials do not need to be stored in client applications.

      summary: Vote in an election
      description: >-
        In a _majority judgment_ voting system, instead of choosing _one_ candidate, the voter
        gives a _rating_ to _every_ candidate present in the election.
        In our system, the ratings go from `1` to `7` (higher is better) and have the following
        names :

          1. Terrible
          2. Bad
          3. Inadequate
          4. Passable
          5. Sufficient
          6. Good
          7. Excellent

        This allows the voter to give a more complex opinion that will be taken into account in the
        voting system.
        Please note that a valid ballot must contain a rating for _every_ candidate.

      summary: Get results of an election
      description: >-
        At the end of the voting period, each candidate gets their _profile_ computed, _i.e._, the
        list of proportions of voters that gave them each rating.
        The winner is determined by computing the _majority ratings_.
        

        The _majority rating_ of a candidate is the _highest_ rating for which
        _strictly more than half_ of the voters gave them _at least_ this rating.
        In other words, if we were to sort ratings in _increasing_ order, the majority rating would
        be the rating in the _middle_, _i.e._, rating number `k` if there are `2k` ratings, or
        rating number `k + 1` if there are `2k + 1` ratings.
        The winner is the candidate with the highest majority rating.


        The response of this endpoint includes both the majority ratings and the scores for each
        rating in _increasing_ order, for each candidate.


        ### Note

        In case of a tie, a more complex tie-breaking computation is carried
        out by the server.
        In fact, the Major system implements the original tie-breaking strategy proposed by the
        creators of majority judgment, Balinski & Laraki, described in an
        [article by Adrien Fabre (line 189)](https://shs.hal.science/halshs-04363059/file/Tie-breaking%20Highest%20Median.pdf).


        When there is a tie on a majority rating, we exclude all the candidates who did not get this
        rating.
        Then, we remove the median vote of the remaining winners, _i.e._, the first vote justifying
        that they got this majority rating.
        It means that the winner will now be decided on one less ballot than the first round.


        We loop this process until no ballot is available anymore.
        If there is still a tie, it means all the remaining candidates have the exact rating
        distribution, which, if the election has a big enough amount of voters, is highly unlikely.
